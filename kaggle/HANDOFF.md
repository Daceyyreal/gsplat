# Handoff: gsplat `PngCompression` benchmark (`bench/tilequant`)

For a fresh session. Results live in `kaggle/FINDINGS.md`; this file covers how the work is organized.

## Context and rules

Dace (ICCA 2026 paper "Beyond Naive INT8") is testing whether gsplat's `PngCompression` can be improved
upstream (nerfstudio-project/gsplat). There is no local NVIDIA GPU, so all GPU work runs on Kaggle
(2x T4).

Standing rules from Dace:

- **Numbers:** every number must come from result files or actual runs. Never estimate or fill in values.
  Tables of numbers Dace reported must be labeled as such.
- **History:** never rewrite pushed history (no rebase, amend or force-push on pushed branches). Push
  fast-forward only; check with `git merge-base --is-ancestor fork/<branch> <branch>` first. Ask before
  any destructive git operation.
- **Scope:** commit only to feature branches on the fork. Don't open PRs or post comments unless asked.
  Work only on the branch the current task names.
- **Git access:** there is no `gh` CLI and no Kaggle credentials. The unauthenticated GitHub API
  rate-limits quickly, so read issues and PRs on github.com pages.

## Repository and branches

Clone: `F:\gsplat`. Remotes: `origin` = nerfstudio-project/gsplat, `fork` = github.com/Daceyyreal/gsplat.
Upstream main at the time of this work: `28e794c`.

| `feat/png-tile-quantization` (`3ff67e8`) | `PngCompression(tile_size=, bits=)` | benchmark said no PR; leave alone |
| `bench/tilequant` | feat merged + benchmark code and results; never goes upstream | active; head = `git log -1 fork/bench/tilequant` |

Untracked local drafts (excluded in `.git/info/exclude`, never commit or post): `PR_DRAFT_empty_tensor.md`,
`ISSUE_566_COMMENT.md`, `ISSUE_787_COMMENT.md`.

## File map (`kaggle/`)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `build_tilequant_bench.py` | generates `tilequant_bench.ipynb`. **Edit the builder, never the JSON**; the committed notebook must equal the builder output (`python kaggle/build_tilequant_bench.py`). |
| `tilequant_bench.ipynb` | Kaggle notebook (build output) |
| `tilequant_sweep.py` / `tilequant_analysis.py` | run 1: tile / global / smooth-range PNG params; PLAS sort cache; `build_runner`, `evaluate`, `dir_sizes`, sanity gate, repo-row reader, plot style |
| `tilequant_shn.py` / `tilequant_shn_analysis.py` | run 2: shN codebook (`ShnBenchCompression`, `precomputed_kmeans`, decomposition P/S/F) |
| `tilequant_run3.py` / `tilequant_run3_analysis.py` | run 3: clustering levers (`lloyd`, `torchpq_kmeans`, `cluster_weights`, `decide_run3`) |
| `FINDINGS.md` | results write-up, every number from the committed bundles |
| `run2/tilequant/` | results bundle (`results_bundle.zip` contents) of each Kaggle session |

CPU dry runs are **not in the repo**. They live in the scratchpad of session `51b5c32d`:
`C:\Users\Dace\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\F--\51b5c32d-122a-4650-8d8a-533b96ba5785\scratchpad\ref\dryrun_*.py`
(run with `F:\gsplat\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`, `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`). Library tests:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_compression.py` (bench: 52 passed, 1 skipped on CPU).

## Notebook

- **Config cell:** `RUN_MODE`, `ALLOW_WHEEL_BUILD`, `INPUT_ROOT`, scenes, and the helpers `sh`,
  `record_timing` and `run_on_gpus` (job i of a batch on GPU i, one CSV per scene).
- **Discovery cell (before any install):** walks `/kaggle/input` recursively for the anchors
  `results/`, `tilequant/` and `wheels/`, and restores them into `/kaggle/working`. In a resume mode it
  raises before any install if required inputs are missing, and prints the input tree.
- **Install cell:** uses a restored gsplat wheel whose key matches (gsplat/ tree + setup.py + torch +
  GPU arch). In a resume mode it never builds without `ALLOW_WHEEL_BUILD` (the build takes about
  73 min). Any change under `gsplat/` changes the key.
- **Run cells:** training, current-main gate and the cells of earlier runs are gated by `RUN_MODE`
  (if/else, never `raise SystemExit`).
- **Final cell:** writes `/kaggle/working/results_bundle.zip` (top-level csv/json/png files of
  `tilequant/`, arcname `tilequant/`).
- **Run modes:**
  - `full`: runs everything missing.
  - `run3`: needs the run-2 output.
  - `run4` (in preparation): will need the run-3 output or a partial run-4 output.
- **Kaggle steps:**
  1. Import the notebook from
     `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daceyyreal/gsplat/bench/tilequant/kaggle/tilequant_bench.ipynb`.
  2. Attach the previous session's notebook output as input.
  3. Set GPU T4 x2 and Internet on.
  4. Save & Run All.
  5. Bring back `results_bundle.zip`. It has landed in `~/Downloads` (sometimes as
     `results_bundle (1).zip`), not the repo, so search there.

## Conventions and gotchas

- **Setup:** MipNeRF360, `examples/benchmarks/compression/mcmc.sh` settings (MCMC, cap 1M, data factor 4
  outdoor / 2 indoor, LPIPS VGG for eval). Data lives under `/tmp`, output in `/kaggle/working`.
  `MAX_JOBS=2` (higher values OOM the build).
- **Size:** `zip_bytes` (`zip -r`, as in `summarize_stats.py`) AND `size_bytes` (raw file bytes).
  Decisions use both.
- **Library shN path:** `_compress_kmeans` runs torchpq `KMeans(65536, distance="manhattan")`, quantizes
  the codebook to 6 bits with one scalar min/max and stores uint16 labels.
  - The codebook is saved **column-major** (via permute), and new encoders must match
    (`np.asfortranarray`), or bytes and sizes differ.
  - The run-2/3 baseline feeds cached float centroids and labels into the unchanged `_compress_kmeans`
    through a stub (`precomputed_kmeans`). Its output is byte-identical to a normal call.
- **torchpq 0.3.0.6 `KMeans`:**
  - Random init (`np.random.choice` of k points, global numpy RNG), `max_iter=100`, `tol=1e-4` on the
    summed squared centroid change (practically unreachable in 100 iterations), `n_redo=1`.
  - manhattan = L1 assignment + MEAN update. Empty clusters become 0. Returned labels come from the last
    assignment.
  - Deterministic per seed across sessions: the run-3 re-run reproduced run-2 seed 0 exactly (same raw
    bytes and metrics).
- **PLAS sort:** the seed-0 order is cached per checkpoint (`tilequant/sweep/<scene>/cache/seed0/order.pt`,
  keyed by the checkpoint sha1). Run 3 loads it and never rebuilds.
- **Timings** (`timings.json`; job timings are rounded up to the 15 s poll):
  - training: garden 2280 s, bicycle 2145 s (data factor 4, T4)
  - torchpq manhattan k-means: 398–440 s
  - per config (compress + decompress + eval): about 13–15 s
  - per job: about 40 s of process overhead
- **Local environment:**
  - venv `F:\gsplat\.venv` (CPU torch 2.11, Python 3.13).
  - Working copies are CRLF (`autocrlf`): normalize line endings when string-matching.
  - Bash heredocs with nested quotes break: write scripts to files.
  - Use `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` for console output.

## Results so far (details and sources in `FINDINGS.md`)

| Run | Question | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | tile-wise / smooth min/max for PNG params | no win; `pr_worthy` false |
| 2 | shN codebook quantization ranges; loss decomposition | no win; clustering is most of the shN loss (0.374 / 0.163 dB garden / bicycle) |
| 3 | k-means clustering levers (library format unchanged) | `pr_worthy` false under the strict rule. `lloyd_wopa_area` gains +0.096 / +0.030 dB mean PSNR over 3 seeds and fails only on garden SSIM, by amounts within seed noise. |
| 4 | full MipNeRF360 validation of `lloyd_wopa` / `lloyd_wopa_area` | in preparation |

## Open items

- Run 3 write-up: add a run-3 section to `FINDINGS.md` and commit the run-3 bundle under `kaggle/run3/`
  (bundle currently in `~/Downloads/results_bundle (1)/tilequant/`).
- Run 4 (MipNeRF360, 9 scenes): benchmark code, CPU dry runs, then a Kaggle session.
- If run 4 names a `pr_candidate`: any library PR needs Dace's go-ahead, a clean branch off upstream
  main (not `bench/tilequant`) and a CPU-testable implementation.
- PR #1061 (`fix/png-empty-tensor`): no action unless asked.
